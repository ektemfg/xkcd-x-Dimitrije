# The Shortcutter's Challenge - iOS

Challenge is here: (https://github.com/shortcut/coding-assignment-mobile)

THE TASK:The task was to build an iOS app that allows users to browse and search for comics from the XKCD webcomic series. 




## # Tasks I completed:
✅ Browse through the comics,

✅ See the comic details, including its description.

✅ Search for comics by the comic number, 
as well as text via Relevantxkcd and Google

✅ Get the comic explanation

✅ Favorite the comics, available offline too.

Images are not cached offline, but Comics are.

✅ Send comics to others - You can share them!

🚫Get notifications when a new comic is published

✅ Support multiple form factors - Looks good on different iOS devices.


## Thought process - Lets do this!
Reading thought assignment:
I approached this project with great excitement, I wanted to create something I would be satisfied with and learn a lot from. 

It took some time to understand what was being asked of me, and made sure that I understood the task.

## Choosing the right tools: 
This one was tricky. I wanted to challenge myself to try and create the whole app using only UiKit. But I soon understood that using the technologies I love the most would not just make me learn even more, but also make the whole challenge much more fun.
That’s why I decided I will use Swift and SwiftUI for this challenge - why? Because they are simply the best. 😉

## Organising the project:
I started by organising the project in the way that made sense to me , grouping related files and components together so I could at all times easily find what I need, thus keeping the code structured and readable.

## Building a solid architecture:
I choose to go for MVVM stricture with Repository/API pattern ++
Even though the code is not perfect, the architecture choice made the app easier for potential colleagues / other developers to understand the codebase  faster and get to know it in shorter timespan.

## Writing code:
I tried to keep code easy and understandable, using good naming conventions and also commented places I felt like I should to make it as clear as possible.

## Testing:
I spend some time manually testing the app, but I did also write some tests which are testing ViewModel functions. All of them pass every build so I am even more confident, and it’s easier to see if potential changes in the code would create issues.

## Keeping things interesting and never satisfied with MVP: 
I had so much fun at working  on this app that I never was satisfied with the MVP. It eventually ended in completing nearly all tasks. I just wanted to experiment with the code and have as much fun as I can in limited timespan. 

## Things I am proud of:
Things I am proud of:
This is something I am proud of when it comes to “xkcd x Dimitrije” app:
* MVVM Architecture to keep the code clean and maintainable, and expandable.
* Native frameworks and libraries -> Keeping the codebase under control - easier to maintain - less risk of security breaches / malicious code finding its way into the app
* Tests - I love writing tests and I look forward to getting much better at writing both Unit, Integration and UX/UI tests.
* VCS history: I made frequent and easy to understand commits to version control, so you can see the progress.

## Things I could have done better:
Things I feel like I could have done better:
* One area where I think I could have improved is by focusing on fewer app features and ensuring that they were cooked perfectly. 

* While I'm happy with the end result , I think I may have taken on too much, and it may have been better to prioritize a smaller set of features.

I don't think this was due to a lack of planning or structure, as I generally try to be organized in my approach. However, when it comes to technical challenges and personal projects, I sometimes tend to get carried away and enjoy experimenting with code. 

On the other hand, I find it easier to stay on task when working on professional projects, especially when working with others.

* Some code could be shrinked and they is some double logic code I could have removed





## Thank you!
Thank you for your time and consideration. 🤩
